      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Rodney Baloyi, a passionate and dedicated aspiring software engineer. With a strong interest in technology and problem-solving, I’m on a mission to develop impactful digital solutions and build a career in the tech industry.</p>
      <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, learning about emerging technologies, and collaborating with others on creative projects. I believe in continuous learning and personal growth, and I’m committed to challenging myself every step of the way.</p>

      <h3>What I Do</h3>
<p>
  I specialize in building responsive and accessible web pages using core technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  Through the ALX Software Engineering program, I’ve gained a strong foundation in front-end development and
  professional practices in tech.
</p>

<p>
  So far, we've covered:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Professional Development in Tech</strong> – focusing on mindset, communication, and productivity in the tech space.</li>
    <li><strong>Git & GitHub</strong> – using version control tools for collaboration, mastering branching, merging, and pull requests.</li>
    <li><strong>UI/UX Design</strong> – understanding user needs and designing intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML & CSS</strong> – creating structured, styled web pages with best practices in layout and design.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript (Intro)</strong> – learning core programming concepts such as variables, functions, control flow, and the DOM.</li>
    <li><strong>Leveraging AI for Learning</strong> – using AI tools effectively to debug, study smarter, and boost productivity (e.g., prompt engineering and prompt cheatsheets).</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  This portfolio showcases some of my hands-on work and growth as a developer. I’m passionate about technology and
  committed to continuous learning. My goal is to contribute to innovative teams and bring real-world solutions to life through code.
